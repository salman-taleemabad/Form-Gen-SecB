Understanding Fractions

Student Learning Objective
* Identify different types of fractions: proper, improper, and mixed numbers.
* Convert between improper fractions and mixed numbers.

Summary
Today's lesson focuses on understanding fractions through visual representations and hands-on activities.
Students will work with fraction circles and number lines to develop conceptual understanding.
Collaborative activities will reinforce learning through peer discussion and problem-solving.

Resources
Fraction circles, number lines, textbook pages 45-48, whiteboard.

Opening
Say: Good morning! Today we'll explore fractions that are all around us.
Ask: Can anyone give me an example of when we use fractions in daily life?
Expected answers: Cooking, sharing pizza, measuring ingredients.
Instruction: Show fraction circles and ask students to identify what they see.

Explanation
Say: A fraction represents parts of a whole. Let's look at different types.
Instruction: Using fraction circles, demonstrate proper fractions (1/2, 2/3, 3/4).
Say: These are proper fractions because the numerator is smaller than the denominator.
Instruction: Show improper fractions (5/3, 7/4) using multiple circles.
Ask: What do you notice about these fractions?
Expected answer: The numerator is larger than the denominator.

Guided Practice
Instruction: Work in pairs to sort fraction cards into proper and improper fractions.
Say: Discuss with your partner why you placed each fraction in its category.
Instruction: Walk around and provide guidance, asking probing questions.
Ask: How can you tell if 8/5 is proper or improper?

Independent Practice
Instruction: Complete worksheet on page 47, identifying and converting fractions.
Say: Remember to show your work and use the fraction circles if needed.
Instruction: Circulate and provide individual support as needed.

Conclusion
Ask: What's the difference between proper and improper fractions?
Say: Great work today! Remember that fractions help us describe parts of wholes.
Instruction: Assign homework problems 1-10 on page 48.
