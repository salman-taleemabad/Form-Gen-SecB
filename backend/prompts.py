SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert lesson fidelity rubric generator. Your job is to create a lesson-specific JSON rubric for indicators B1–B11 based ONLY on the provided lesson plan.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Use ONLY evidence and language explicitly present in the provided lesson plan
2. Do NOT generalize, infer, or add information not directly stated
3. Make descriptions specific to the actual lesson content, not generic
4. For each indicator, provide "Yes", "Partial", and "No" criteria that reflect:
   - YES: Complete fulfillment based on lesson plan evidence
   - PARTIAL: Incomplete or limited evidence in the lesson plan  
   - NO: Total absence of evidence in the lesson plan
5. For each indicator, think step by step: (a) Identify all relevant evidence in the lesson plan, (b) Compare it to the official indicator and rubric rules, (c) Decide the most accurate Yes/Partial/No description using only the lesson plan's language and details.

**MANDATORY RUBRIC RULES:**
- For B1: Yes = SLO is clearly stated both verbally and in written form at the beginning, and the Yes description must quote or paraphrase the actual SLO(s) from the lesson plan (e.g., 'The teacher states and writes: "Write a letter following correct grammar and format. Explain traffic and safety rules in simple English."'); Partial = SLO is stated either verbally or in written form, but not both; No = SLO is not stated at all—neither verbally nor in written form.
- For B5: Yes = The teacher addresses all levels of Bloom's Taxonomy mentioned in the lesson plan (e.g., Understanding, Applying, Creating); Partial = The instruction reflects alignment with the SLO but covers only one level of Bloom's Taxonomy; No = The instruction does not align with the cognitive level of the SLO and none of Bloom's levels are effectively addressed.
- For B6: Yes = The teacher effectively incorporates more than one 21st century skill mentioned in the lesson plan (e.g., communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity); Partial = The teacher incorporates only one of the 21st century skills listed in the lesson plan; No = The teacher does not incorporate any of the 21st century skills identified in the lesson plan.
- For B11: Yes = The teacher concludes the lesson on time by summarizing key points and student responses, ensuring clarity before ending the class; Partial = The teacher attempts to summarize or close the lesson but misses either key points, student responses, or does not ensure clarity; No = The teacher does not summarize key points or student responses, or the lesson ends without clear closure.

**OFFICIAL INDICATORS B1-B11:**
B1: The teacher clearly states the lesson's objectives at the start verbally and in written form.
B2: The teacher uses either the resources outlined in the lesson plan or alternative resources facilitating the SLO.
B3: The teacher applies the suggested learning methodologies to facilitate effective lesson delivery.
B4: The teacher clearly relates classroom activities to the stated objectives.
B5: The teacher delivers instruction that aligns with the cognitive level of the lesson's stated learning objective.
B6: The teacher effectively incorporates 21st century skills into the instructional process.

Classroom Manners - Reading

Student Learning Objective
Pronounce the vocabulary related to classroom manners fluently.
Identify key vocabulary words from the text through reading.
Engage in reading to practice sentence stress and intonation effectively.

Summary
Today's lesson focuses on Classroom Manners, using storytelling and interactive reading from textbook pages 75-78.
The lesson begins with critical thinking as students compare classroom scenes using a story about a new student, Zara.
You'll guide reading sessions and engage students through reading activities that address identified SLOs.
Encourage collaboration in group-based activities that enhance reading fluency, using techniques like 'Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down' for assessment.
Independent practice further solidifies learning with individualized reading tasks, and classroom manners exercises reinforce behaviour outside the classroom.

**WORKED EXAMPLE 4:**

Lesson Plan:
Circles

Student Learning Objective
Identify and describe the parts of a circle: radius, diameter, and circumference.
Draw and label the parts of a circle accurately in a notebook.

Summary
The lesson aimed to help students identify and describe the parts of a circle, such as radius, diameter, and circumference. It covered textbook pages 187-190.
The teacher engaged students using the CPA approach, focusing on pictorial representations and abstract understanding.
Assessment involved interaction with the students using Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down to verify understanding, complemented by independent practice.
Bloom's Taxonomy: Understanding and Applying - covered in Explanation and Independent Practice.
21st-century skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving were fostered during Guided and Independent Practice.

Resources
A circle paper for demonstration. Circular objects (e.g., plates, lids). Visual aids like cut-outs or drawings showing 'radius', 'diameter', and 'circumference' with labels for classroom display. Textbook pages 187-189 - reference for diagrams and explanations of circle parts.

Opening
Instruction: Begin the lesson by gathering students' attention and introducing the topic of circles.
Ask: Can anyone tell me about circle objects we often see around us in everyday life?
Ans: Wheels, plates, clocks, and coins.
Instruction: Show a circular object, like a plate or a lid, to the students.
Ask: What is the shape of this object?
Ans: A circle.
Ask: Does it have any sides?
Ans: No.
Ask: Does it have any corner?
Ans: No.
Instruction: Transition into the explanation by stating, 'Now that we have identified the shape, let's understand its different parts and learn how to visually represent and label them.'

Explanation
Instruction: Begin by displaying a large circle of paper. Fold the paper in half to show diameter then again fold it to show radius.
Ask: Can anyone point out what the centre of this circle is called?
Ans: The centre of the circle is called 'O'.
Say: In a circle, the distance from the centre to any point on the circle is the 'radius'.
Instruction: Draw and label a line from the centre, O, to the edge of the circle as 'r' for radius.
Say: The line segment joining the centre to a point on the circle is called a 'radius'. Each radius in a circle is the same length.
Instruction: Next, let's draw a line passing through the centre that touches two points on the circle. This is called the 'diameter'.
Instruction: Label the ends of the diameter as 'A' and 'B' with the centre remaining 'O' and indicate 'd' for diameter.
Say: Notice how the diameter is made up of two radii joined end to end. Therefore, the diameter is twice the radius: d = 2r.
Ask: If the radius is 5 cm, what would the diameter be?
Ans: The diameter would be 10 cm because 5 cm times 2 equals 10 cm.
Instruction: Let's illustrate the concept of 'circumference'.
Say: The circumference is the distance around the circle, similar to the distance a wheel would cover in one turn.
Instruction: Draw an arrow around the circle to indicate one complete loop as the circumference.
Ask: Why do you think understanding the circumference is important in real-life scenarios?
Ans: Understanding the circumference can help us know how far a wheel will travel or how much material is needed to wrap around a circular object.
Instruction: Conclude the explanation by recalling all the definitions.

Guided Practice
Instruction: Pair students and have them work on these questions. Encourage students to discuss their thought process with their partner.
Instruction: Draw a circle, and measure its radius and diameter.
Instruction: When everyone is done ask them to display their circles and its diameter and circle.
Instruction: Encourage students to label parts of their drawings clearly and to verify each other's work.
Instruction: Circulate the classroom to provide guidance and ensure all students participate. If a student is confused, guide them by revisiting the definitions of radius and diameter using practical examples.

Independent practice
Ask: Solve the following questions from your textbook on page 190 in your notebooks.
Instruction: Question: 2. Write the names of the parts of the circles (all parts)
Instruction: Walk around the classroom, observe students, and provide assistance as necessary.
Instruction: Ask guiding questions to students who are struggling, like 'Where is the center of the circle?' or 'How is the diameter related to the radius?'
Instruction: Praise students for their efforts and correct reasoning. Reinforce concepts by asking them to explain their process.

Conclusion
Instruction: Conduct a Thumbs-up/Thumbs-down activity to assess students' understanding of the parts of a circle.
Ask: If I draw a line from the centre of the circle to its edge, is that line called the radius?
Ans: Thumbs up 👍🏻.
Ask: Does the diameter of a circle pass through its centre and extend to both edges?
Ans: Thumbs up 👍🏻.
Ask: Is the circumference the distance across the circle from one side to the other?
Ans: Thumbs down 👎🏻.
Ask: If a radius is 5 cm, does that mean the diameter would be 10 cm?
Ans: Thumbs up 👍🏻.

EXAMPLE_LESSON_PLAN = """Understanding Pronouns

Student Learning Objective
* Identify subject, object, and possessive pronouns in sentences.
* Write sentences using each type of pronoun correctly.

Summary
Today's lesson focuses on understanding pronouns, such as subject, object, and possessive pronouns.
The initial mind-mapping activity introduces critical thinking skills through visual connections.
Use textbook material on page 116 for guided exercises and discussions.
Engage students in pairs for collaborative practice and individual tasks for comprehension.
Conclude with 'Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down' to assess understanding of pronouns effectively.

Resources
Textbook page 116.

Opening
Say: Good morning, students! Today, we'll explore some special words we use every day in a fun way. Let's start with a quick activity!
Instruction: Ask students to raise their hands if they're ready to play a mind game.
Ask: Write the phrase 'I would…' on the board. (Ask students to complete the sentence.)
Ans: Possible answers: 'I would like to watch a movie,' 'I would eat my favourite food.'
Instruction: Invite a few students to share their ideas with the class.
Say: Wonderful! Did you notice how we used words like 'I,' 'you,' and 'my'? These are special words we use every day. Let's dive deeper into learning more about them!

Explanation
Instruction: Write 'Pronouns' on the board and underline it.
Instruction: Draw a simple mind map on the board connecting Pronouns to three branches: Subject, Object, and Possessive.
Say: This mind map shows how pronouns do different jobs. Let's understand these, one by one!
Instruction: Point to 'Subject' on the mind map and write examples: I, he, she, we, they, It.
Say: Subject pronouns tell us who is doing the action in a sentence. Examples: I play cricket. He draws well.
Ask: Who is doing the action in these sentences?
Ans: 'I' and 'He'
Instruction: Point to 'Object' on the mind map and write examples: me, her, him, us, them.
Say: Object pronouns tell us who is receiving the action. Example Context: Bilal and Sara went to a park. Bilal gave a ball to her.
Ask: Can anyone tell me what 'her' is doing here?
Ans: It shows who received the ball.
Instruction: Point to Possessive Pronouns on the mind map and write examples: mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs.
Say: Possessive pronouns show what belongs to someone. Examples: This pen is mine. That book is hers.
Ask: What does 'mine' show?
Ans: It shows the pen belongs to me.
Instruction: Encourage students to think of questions like Whose pen is this? or Who owns this book? to better understand possessive pronouns.
Say: Great work, everyone! Now let's practice using these pronouns in sentences!

Guided Practice
Say: Now that we know about Subject Pronouns, Object Pronouns, and Possessive Pronouns, let's use them to create sentences!
Instruction: Pair Work: Ask students to pair up with the student sitting next to them. Each pair will write three sentences—one for each type of pronoun (subject, object, possessive) in their notebook.
Ans: Sample Sentences: We are going to the park. (Subject Pronoun). He gave the ball to us. (Object Pronoun). The ball is ours. (Possessive Pronoun)
Instruction: Once done, call each pair to share their sentences with the class Write a few student-generated sentences on the board for discussion.
Instruction: Walk around to guide and check if pairs are using pronouns correctly. Provide constructive feedback after pairs share their sentences.
Say: Great teamwork! You've learned how to use all three types of pronouns in sentences. Keep practising, and you'll get even better!

Independent practice
Say: Now that you have practiced with a partner, let's put your skills to the test on your own.
Instruction: Turn to page 116 in your textbook.
Instruction: Complete Exercise ii where you need to write two subject, two object, and two possessive pronouns each with sentences in your notebooks.
Ask: If you need help, what sentence could you try first?
Ans: I could start with 'I have a cat.'
Instruction: Remind students that they can look back at examples they created with their partners earlier.
Instruction: Tell students to raise their hand if they finish early and check with you for accuracy.
Instruction: Walk around the class, providing help as needed and checking sentences.
Instruction: Encourage students to refine sentences or try another if they seem confident.
Instruction: Reassure students that this is their chance to show how much they've learned today.

Conclusion
Instruction: Let's wrap up our lesson with a quick game.
Ask: Thumbs up if this is true: 'A pronoun never acts as a subject in a sentence.'
Ans: Thumbs down, because pronouns can act as subjects.
Ask: Thumbs up if this is true: 'Possessive pronouns show what belongs to someone.'
Ans: Thumbs up, because possessive pronouns do show ownership.
Instruction: Great job! Remember to think about how pronouns work with the sentences you create.

Homework
Observe your surroundings and identify pronouns you hear; try to write three sentences at home. Complete the missing letters on page 115 under 'Learing to Spell' in the textbook."""
